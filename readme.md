# Information

A repository for base projects for .NET 5, C#9 which can be exported as templates and used from Visual Studio `start window`.

Several projects require NuGet packages which can be fixed by running `NuGet restore packages`.

:bulb: Pin the ones used often in the `start window`

- Templates are place in the following folder. To share, give the .zip file to another developer and they drop the file in their Export folder.
- For the developer who is given the zip file, they should have Visual Studio close.
- For the developer who exported the template, the template is immediately available. Suggest pinning the project template to the projection selection in the start window,
